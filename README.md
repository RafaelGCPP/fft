# Simple FFT for embedded use

This code implements a rudimentary Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for both real and complex valued sequences. It is specifically designed for embedded systems, utilizing floating-point arithmetic and precomputed twiddle factors to optimize performance.

## TODO

I plan to implement a fixed-point version using 32 bit integers, so data from an ADC can be immediately converted.
